Results Isolation and Identification of Endophytic Bacteria A total of 160 cultivable endophytic bacteria isolates were isolated from the sterilized potato tubers. All the isolated strains were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and compared by the EzBioCloud (2018) database. All of the endophytic bacteria were classified into 3 different phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria), 18 genera, and 37 species. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the 37 strains were submitted to the NCBI GenBank with the Accession Numbers (MT533892-MT533928) and dominated by Microbacterium (21.62%) and Streptomyces (18.92%) (Figure 1). A phylogenetic tree was constructed for these 37 isolates to demonstrate their evolutionary phylogenetic relationship (Figure 2). In terms of genus diversity, the phylogenetic tree in Figure 2 showed that Microbacterium was dominant harboring eight strains, followed by Streptomyces with seven strains, and Glutamicibacter with three strains. Each of the genus Paenarthrobacter, Nocardioides, Rhodococcus, and Brevibacterium harbored two strains. Meanwhile, other genera harbored one strain. Antimicrobial Activity of Endophytic Bacteria Against Phytopathogens The 37 strains were tested for their antimicrobial activity against E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica (Van Hall) dye (ACCC 19901) and S. scabies (ACCC 41024) using the Kirby-Bauer method. Nine strains showed antimicrobial activity against at least one pathogen. These nine strains belonged to eight different genera, namely Shinella, Bacillus, Rhodococcus, Phyllobacterium, Streptomyces, Rhizobium, Microbacterium, and Brevibacterium. All the nine strains showed antimicrobial activity against the E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica (Van Hall) dye in this study, while only three strains showed antimicrobial activity against the S. scabies (Table 1). The extracts of the strain P-HV18 (S. kummerowiae CCBAU 25048T, 98.74%) showed the highest antimicrobial activity against the two phytopathogens. The pictures of the antimicrobial activity of some strains against phytopathogens are shown in Supplementary Figure 1. Inhibitory Activity on Solanine in Potato Tubers The solanine content of potato tubers were analyzed by UPLC-QQQ-MS/MS after being treated with fermentation broth of the 37 strains (Figure 3). Compared with the control group (YIM38 liquid medium without endophytic bacterial isolates), 23 strains showed inhibition of solanine in potato tubers, while 14 strains increased the content of solanine. As a common potato bud suppressor in the market, CIPC (positive control) can inhibit the content of solanine in potato tubers with an inhibition rate of 10.52%. Interestingly, there were 15 strains that showed a better inhibition activity than CIPC. The activity was as follows: P-NA2-14 (38.37%), P-YIM15 (38.07%), P-YIM40 (36.11%), P-BL63 (33.63%), P-R2A48 (33%), P-GP61 (32.67%), P-GP2-2 (31.45%), P-RH5 (28.05%), P-YIM2 (26.59%), P-RA6 (24.19%), P-NA3-2 (21.62%), P-RA5 (20.30%), P-R2A55 (19.24%), P-GP62 (13.94%), and P-CM (10.58%) (Table 2). Among them, strain P-NA2-14 (B. megaterium NBRC 15308T, 99.31%) showed the highest inhibition on the content of solanine and was selected for further study. It is worth noting that strain P-TW21 (Phyllobacterium ifriqiyense STM 370T, 99.49%) could make the content of solanine in potato tuber obviously increase, which also needed further study. Extraction of Active Components of Strain P-NA2-14 After being treated with seven different groups of ingredients, the inhibition rates of solanine in potatoes are shown in Figure 4. Among them, P-NA2-14A (71.8%), JY (51.7%), P-NA2-14EA (45.75%), and JT (21.35%) showed better inhibition on solanine than others, while P-NA2-14A (71.8%) showed the highest inhibitory activity. P-NA2-14A was selected for further separation of the active ingredients since it had the highest inhibitory activity. P-NA2-14A was separated into different components after the preliminary screening (Figure 5). Meanwhile, the active components which showed inhibition to solanine were obtained. Among the 21 different components, 14 active ingredients showed inhibitory activity on solanine, while 7 active ingredients increased the content of solanine compared to the control group. As for the 21 active ingredients, group 40–20 (inhibition rates of solanine was 41.82%) showed the best inhibitory activity, while group 20–30 (inhibition rates of solanine was −22.32%) could obviously increase the content of solanine in potato tubers. Therefore, group 40–20 and group 20–30 were selected for Illumina-based analysis in order to study the influence of those compositions on the distribution of endophytic bacteria in potato tubers. The 21 active ingredients were extracted from the fermentation products of the strain P-NA2-14A at different times by using acetone solution of different proportions. The analysis of the specific composition of each active ingredient was carried out next in our study.

Diversity of Endophytic Bacteria Based on Illumina-Based Analysis Quality Control and Analysis of Sequencing Data A total of 614,140 reads and 1,528 OTUs were obtained after clustering at a 97% similarity level from the 3 groups: Group CK, Group L, and Group H (three parallel in each group). As the rarefaction curves tended to approach saturation, this showed that the sequencing work was relatively comprehensive in covering the bacterial diversity and the selected sequence data adequately reflected the bacterial abundance of the samples (Supplementary Figure 2). The distributions of endophytic microbial composition on the OTU level in different samples were also detected using the Alpha-diversity analyses including Shannon, Sobs, Simpson, Chao, Ace, and Coverage to estimate the endophytic community complexity (Table 3). Sobs, Chao, and Ace indexes reflected the community richness. Shannon and Simpson indexes reflected the community diversity, while Coverage indexes reflected the community coverage (Kim et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017). The community abundance of endophytes on OTU level in Group L was higher than the other two groups. The differences in OTU abundance of the 3 groups is also shown in the Venn diagram. The OTU abundance of endophytic bacterial was the highest in Group L with the lowest solanine content. The three groups shared 523 OTUs, while they each harbored 76 (Group CK), 494 (Group L), and 134 (Group H) unique OTUs, respectively (Figure 6). Composition and Diversity of Endophytic Bacterial Community in Different Groups The 99.99% of bacterial sequences were classified from phylum to genus and 0.01% were unclassified. The valid sequences were classified into 24 different phyla, 47 classes, 122 orders, 280 families, 574 genera, and 942 species. In total, Proteobacteria (42.22%) was the dominant phylum, following by Actinobacteria (28.95%), Firmicutes (24.12%), and Bacteroidetes (3.68%), the remaining 1.03% contained 20 very low-abundant phyla (Figure 7). While the distribution of endophytic bacterial was different in each group. The results showed that the distribution of each dominant genus also varied among the three groups. Overall, Bacillus (18.81%) accounted for the highest proportion of the 3 groups, followed by Pantoea (16.92%), and Rhodococcus (7.68%), while there were 33.48% genera with below 1% abundance (Figure 8A). Meanwhile, Group L had the highest community abundance, followed by Group H, and Group CK had lowest community abundance (Figure 8B). However, the dominant genera were different from each other. There were 18 genera with over 1% abundance in Group CK and the dominant genera were Pantoea (53.06%) and Bacillus (10.16%). There were 18 genera with over 1% abundance in Group L and the dominant genera were Bacillus (18.61%) and Pantoea (8.55%). There were 20 genera with over 1% abundance in Group H and the dominant genus was Bacillus (24.40%) and Rhodococcus (15.26%). The abundance of the same genus was significantly different among the three groups. For example, although Pantoea was detected in all three groups, it had the highest proportion in the CK Group, accounting for 53.06%, following by Group L (8.55%) and Group H (1.28%). Actinoplanes (2.94%), Lentzea (2.10%), and Nocardioides (2.77%) showed a higher proportion in Group H than the other two groups. Acidibacter (2.46%), Methylotenera (5.13%), Pseudomonas (3.09%), and Tahibacter (2.86%) showed a higher proportion in Group L than the other two groups. Myroides (1.70%) and Polaromonas (1.13%) were only detected in Group L (Table 4).

The significance of inter-group differences among the samples in the grouping were tested using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to conduct the linear discrimination and classification modeling for grouping samples. As shown in PCA analysis, the proportion of PC1 (72.39%) and PC2 (13.61%) indicated that the bacterial community composition of potato tubers with different solanine contents was significantly different at the genus level (Figure 9A). The similarity of endophytic bacteria among samples was also detected by Hierarchical clustering analysis. As shown in the heatmap, it was found that the endophytic community of Group H and Group L obviously clustered, while the endophytic community of Group CK was significantly different from the other two groups. Since all potato samples were stored in the same conditions, it indicated that the solanine content could be an important factor to shape the community composition of endophytic bacteria in potato tubers (Figure 9B). Discussion As an important determinant of promoting plant growth and maintaining plant health, endophytic bacteria have received substantial attention in recent years (Turner et al., 2013; Miliute et al., 2015). Endophytic bacteria of plants may produce a range of different metabolites in vitro and within host plant tissue, which are rich sources of secondary metabolites with biological activity (Brader et al., 2014; Miliute et al., 2015). The bioactive secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, terpenoids, phenols, antibiotics, and anti-cancerous compounds produced by endophytic bacteria have been applied in agricultural, industrial, and medical fields (Christina et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Yamada et al., 2015; Hashem et al., 2016). Bacillus stratosphericus LW-03 isolated from the bulbs of Lilium wardii exhibited multiple plant growth-promoting traits, including the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), organic acids, and siderophores (Khan et al., 2020). The fermentation broth of Aranicola proteolyticus, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus, and Serratia liquefaciens isolated from Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) berit contained alkaloids that were similar to those of the host plants (Liu et al., 2015). In the recent 3 years, at least 128 new endophytic bacteria species of plants were published, including four new genera: Roseitalea, Allobranchiibius, Mangrovicella, and Oceaniradius (Ai et al., 2017; Hyeon et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Jeong et al., 2019). Among them, three new endophytic bacteria strains were isolated from potatoes, including Pectobacterium polaris sp. nov NIBIO1006T (=DSM 105255T = NCPPB 4611T), Pectobacterium parvum s0421T (CFBP 8630T = LMG 30828T), and Sphingobacterium solani sp. nov. MLS-26-JM13-11T (=ACCC 60057T = JCM 32274T) (Dees et al., 2017; Niu et al., 2018; Pasanen et al., 2020). These statistics indicated that, as the treasure troves of new microorganism resources, endophytic bacteria should be given great attention, and it is worthy of further studies on the biological activities of endophytic bacteria such as antimicrobial activity, growth-promoting and bioactive secondary metabolites (Massimiliano et al., 2020). In this study, 160 cultivable endophytic bacteria were isolated and assigned into 3 different phyla, 18 genera, and 37 species. As can be seen from Table 2, all the 18 genera identified in this study have been reported in previous studies (Sturz and Matheson, 1996; Yuan et al., 2002; Ramríez-Bahena et al., 2015a, b). The phylogenetic tree in Figure 2 showed that strain P-GP62 and P-R2A55 have a close relationship with the Microbacterium genus isolates, while the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain P-GP62 (Microbacterium profundi Shh49T, 98.04%) and P-R2A55 (Microbacterium thalassium IFO 16060T, 98.17%) showed a lower similarity rate with the closest species in the 16S rRNA gene sequence database, indicating that they were potential new species, which should be studied further (Figure 2 and Table 4). As the culturable bacteria were part of the largest, most active bacteria in plant samples, culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques need to be combined to identify some rare and promising beneficial endophytic bacteria of potato tubers (Bakken et al., 1997; Ellis et al., 2003). According to the result of the antimicrobial test, nine strains harbored at least one positive antimicrobial activity among the 37 species, but only three strains showed the antimicrobial activity against both the two indicator pathogens, including P-HV18 (S. kummerowiae CCBAU 25048T, 98.74%), P-NA2-14 (B. megaterium NBRC 15308T, 99.31%), and P-GP5-2 (Rhodococcus qingshengii JCM 15477T, 100%). Previous studies have demonstrated that Bacillus strains and Rhodococcus strains of other plants exhibited antibacterial activity (Stein, 2005; Borisova, 2011; Radhakrishnan et al., 2017). In particular, the genus Bacillus is well known for the natural production of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activities and has a very strong biocontrol potential, which not only works against phytopathogens such as Burkholderia solanacearum and Fusarium oxysporum (Yang et al., 2002; Egamberdieva et al., 2017), but also the S. scabies used in this study (Singh and Chaudhari, 2012). However, the antimicrobial activity of Shinella has rarely been reported. The strain P-HV18 (S. kummerowiae CCBAU 25048T, 98.74%) in this study could be used as a new active strain for the study of the antimicrobial activity of endophytic strain. Previous studies have demonstrated that the metabolites and physiological states of a host plant can be affected by some endophytes directly or indirectly in a variety of ways (Strobel and Long, 1998; Etesami et al., 2015; Elshaghabee et al., 2017; Radhakrishnan et al., 2017). In this study, a significant fraction of the endophytic bacteria (62.16%) displayed the effect of inhibiting solanine. Among the 37 species, 23 strains showed inhibitory activity on solanine in potato tubers, while 15 strains had better inhibition on solanine in potato tubers than CIPC (the inhibition rate was 10.52%). Among them, strain P-NA2-14 (the inhibition rate was 38.37%) showed the highest inhibition on the content of solanine. There were very few previous studies on the solanine-degrading bacteria. A method for screening bacteria capable of degrading solanine was successfully developed by Hennessy et al. (2018), and 14 species of bacteria were isolated from potato soil extracts. The results revealed that most of the efficient solanine-degrading strains belonged to the genus Arthrobacter (Hennessy et al., 2018). The other study showed that Bacillus subtilis could regulate the solanine content in healthy and Fusarium-infected tubers of potatoes during storage (Lastochkina et al., 2020). However, the mechanisms of endophytic bacteria regulated the content of solanine were still unclear, which needed further research. It can be seen that the endophytic bacteria could be used as a safe and efficient new technology or product for the degradation of solanine, and biological control will be a promising way to reduce solanine content. Strain P-NA2-14 (B. megaterium NBRC 15308T, 99.31%) showed not only a better antimicrobial activity against the two indicator pathogens, but also the best inhibitory activity on solanine, which was proved to be a potential biocontrol bacterium and was selected for further study. Potato tubers with low and high solanine content were obtained by spraying potato tubers with different active components of the fermentation broth of strain P-NA2-14 to study the relationship between the distribution of endophytic bacterial community and the content of solanine in potato tubers. The results showed obvious differences in the endophytic bacteria community composition among potato tubers with different solanine contents. Pantoea showed the highest proportion in Group CK, Bacillus and Rhodococcus showed the highest proportion in Group H. In addition, Myroides and Polaromonas were only detected in Group L (Table 4). As the promising endophytic bacteria genera for agricultural practices, Pantoea and Bacillus have been extensively studied, which have the ability to dissolve inorganic phosphates, produce siderophores, inhibit the growth of plant pathogens, and produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) among others (Elshaghabee et al., 2017; Soutar and Stavrinides, 2018; Ferreira et al., 2019). The members of Rhodococcus are diverse catalysts that degrade a variety of both natural, organic, and xenobiotic compounds. While, some reports have shown that both Rhodococcus and Polaromonas can promote the transport of sulfur in plants (Borisova, 2011; Gahan and Schmalenberger, 2014; Kim et al., 2018). The application of Myroides in agriculture was rarely reported. Therefore, the isolation and identification of rare endophytic bacteria which were detected in Illumina-based analysis should be carried out by improving the culture conditions and culture techniques, and the interaction between rare endophytic bacteria and host plant metabolites should be studied further. Meanwhile, Group L had the highest endophytic bacterial community abundance and harbored the largest number of unique OTUs, while Group CK had the least endophytic bacterial community abundance, indicating that the content of solanine influences the endophytic community composition in potato tubers (Figures 6, 8B). This was confirmed by the significant separation of the three groups on the results of PCA (Figure 9A). There was no positive correlation between the content of solanine and community composition of endophytic bacteria in potato tubers, which showed that although the content of solanine was a factor to shape the community composition of endophytic bacteria, the active ingredients of group 40–20 (inhibition rates of solanine was 41.82%) and group 20–30 (inhibition rates of solanine was −22.32%) also had some influence on the community composition of endophytic bacteria. While, the endophytic community of Group H and Group L clustered obviously and the endophytic community of Group CK was significantly different from the other two groups (Figure 9B), which further showed that both the active ingredients played an important role in shaping the community composition of endophytic bacteria. However, whether the active ingredients influenced directly on endophytic bacteria composition and then resulted in the change of solanine content, or stimulated directly on the key enzyme genes in the solanine synthesis pathway and then led to changes of community composition of endophytic bacteria is unknown, which should be the main content for illuminating the mechanism of the active ingredients (group 40–20 and group 20–30) for further study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the relationship between the distribution of endophytic bacterial community and the content of solanine in potato tubers by Illumina-based analysis. There is a huge potential to use plant beneficial endophytic bacteria as biofertilizers and biopesticides. Although many such bacteria have been isolated and identified, the complex dynamics that control the plant-endophyte association remains poorly understood. So, we need to identify the subtleties that govern the plant-endophyte relationship at the molecular level. The relationship between the distribution of endophytic bacterial community and the content of solanine in potato tubers was preliminarily explored in this study. Further research is needed to explore the interaction between endophytic community composition and the content of solanine by techniques like RNA-seq and Multi-group analysis technique.
