## Abstract
As an important global crop, the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) contains the endotoxin solanine that leads to human poisoning and major economic losses. Poisoning symptoms and even acute poisoning may occur when the content of solanine in potatoes exceeds 200 mg/kg. In addition, potatoes are susceptible to some pathogenic bacteria, including Streptomyces scabies and Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica (Van Hall) dye, which can cause potato scab and potato blackleg disease, respectively. In this study, 37 culturable endophytic bacteria strains were obtained from potato tubers based on the culture-dependent method. Results indicated that nine strains showed antimicrobial activity against at least one pathogen by antimicrobial activity screening and 23 strains showed inhibitory activity on solanine in potato tubers. Among them, strain P-NA2-14 (Bacillus megaterium NBRC 15308T, 99.31%) showed not only better antimicrobial activity against both the two indicator pathogens, but also the best inhibitory activity on solanine, which was proved to be a potential biocontrol bacterium. Meanwhile, the relationship between the distribution of the endophytic bacterial community and the content of solanine in potato tubers was studied by Illumina-based analysis, indicating that the distribution of the endophytic bacterial community was obviously influenced by the content of solanine. The results showed a new insight into the relationship between plant secondary metabolites and endophytic bacteria in potato tubers and provided potential new technical support for the biological control of potato storage.

## Introduction
<p align="justify"> The project is based on a study about <em>Solanum tuberosum</em> L. (potato), one of the most important food crops worldwide, ranking fourth after rice, wheat, and maize. In this context, it addresses a problem of industrial and health relevance: the increase in solanine content, a toxic compound belonging to the group of steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs), which can cause significant economic losses and pose a risk to human health when it exceeds certain concentration levels. </p>
<p align="justify"> The introduction explains that, although there are chemical and genetic methods to reduce solanine —such as the use of sprout inhibitors (CIPC) or genetic modification— these present significant limitations due to their toxicity or instability. Therefore, the study proposes a safer alternative: the use of endophytic bacteria, beneficial microorganisms that inhabit plant tissues and can help control the increase of solanine, in addition to protecting the tuber against pathogens such as <em>Streptomyces scabies</em> and <em>Erwinia carotovora</em>. </p>
<p align="justify"> The experimental work focuses on the isolation and identification of endophytic bacteria in potato tubers through culture methods, their evaluation by antimicrobial activity, and the correlation between their presence and solanine concentration using Illumina-based sequencing techniques. Ultimately, this study aims to offer a new biotechnological strategy to reduce solanine levels during storage, contributing to improved food safety and agricultural sustainability. </p>

The introduction allows for practicing documentation skills in Markdown, version control, and the use of open licenses (MIT) in academic projects. </p>
