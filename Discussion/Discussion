As an important determinant of promoting plant growth and maintaining plant health, endophytic bacteria have received substantial attention in recent years (Turner et al., 2013; Miliute et al., 2015). Endophytic bacteria of plants may produce a range of different metabolites in vitro and within host plant tissue, which are rich sources of secondary metabolites with biological activity (Brader et al., 2014; Miliute et al., 2015). The bioactive secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, terpenoids, phenols, antibiotics, and anti-cancerous compounds produced by endophytic bacteria have been applied in agricultural, industrial, and medical fields (Christina et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Yamada et al., 2015; Hashem et al., 2016). Bacillus stratosphericus LW-03 isolated from the bulbs of Lilium wardii exhibited multiple plant growth-promoting traits, including the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), organic acids, and siderophores (Khan et al., 2020). The fermentation broth of Aranicola proteolyticus, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus, and Serratia liquefaciens isolated from Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) berit contained alkaloids that were similar to those of the host plants (Liu et al., 2015). In the recent 3 years, at least 128 new endophytic bacteria species of plants were published, including four new genera: Roseitalea, Allobranchiibius, Mangrovicella, and Oceaniradius (Ai et al., 2017; Hyeon et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Jeong et al., 2019). Among them, three new endophytic bacteria strains were isolated from potatoes, including Pectobacterium polaris sp. nov NIBIO1006T (=DSM 105255T = NCPPB 4611T), Pectobacterium parvum s0421T (CFBP 8630T = LMG 30828T), and Sphingobacterium solani sp. nov. MLS-26-JM13-11T (=ACCC 60057T = JCM 32274T) (Dees et al., 2017; Niu et al., 2018; Pasanen et al., 2020). These statistics indicated that, as the treasure troves of new microorganism resources, endophytic bacteria should be given great attention, and it is worthy of further studies on the biological activities of endophytic bacteria such as antimicrobial activity, growth-promoting and bioactive secondary metabolites (Massimiliano et al., 2020).

In this study, 160 cultivable endophytic bacteria were isolated and assigned into 3 different phyla, 18 genera, and 37 species. As can be seen from Table 2, all the 18 genera identified in this study have been reported in previous studies (Sturz and Matheson, 1996; Yuan et al., 2002; Ramríez-Bahena et al., 2015a, b). The phylogenetic tree in Figure 2 showed that strain P-GP62 and P-R2A55 have a close relationship with the Microbacterium genus isolates, while the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain P-GP62 (Microbacterium profundi Shh49T, 98.04%) and P-R2A55 (Microbacterium thalassium IFO 16060T, 98.17%) showed a lower similarity rate with the closest species in the 16S rRNA gene sequence database, indicating that they were potential new species, which should be studied further (Figure 2 and Table 4). As the culturable bacteria were part of the largest, most active bacteria in plant samples, culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques need to be combined to identify some rare and promising beneficial endophytic bacteria of potato tubers (Bakken et al., 1997; Ellis et al., 2003).

According to the result of the antimicrobial test, nine strains harbored at least one positive antimicrobial activity among the 37 species, but only three strains showed the antimicrobial activity against both the two indicator pathogens, including P-HV18 (S. kummerowiae CCBAU 25048T, 98.74%), P-NA2-14 (B. megaterium NBRC 15308T, 99.31%), and P-GP5-2 (Rhodococcus qingshengii JCM 15477T, 100%). Previous studies have demonstrated that Bacillus strains and Rhodococcus strains of other plants exhibited antibacterial activity (Stein, 2005; Borisova, 2011; Radhakrishnan et al., 2017). In particular, the genus Bacillus is well known for the natural production of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activities and has a very strong biocontrol potential, which not only works against phytopathogens such as Burkholderia solanacearum and Fusarium oxysporum (Yang et al., 2002; Egamberdieva et al., 2017), but also the S. scabies used in this study (Singh and Chaudhari, 2012). However, the antimicrobial activity of Shinella has rarely been reported. The strain P-HV18 (S. kummerowiae CCBAU 25048T, 98.74%) in this study could be used as a new active strain for the study of the antimicrobial activity of endophytic strain.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the metabolites and physiological states of a host plant can be affected by some endophytes directly or indirectly in a variety of ways (Strobel and Long, 1998; Etesami et al., 2015; Elshaghabee et al., 2017; Radhakrishnan et al., 2017). In this study, a significant fraction of the endophytic bacteria (62.16%) displayed the effect of inhibiting solanine. Among the 37 species, 23 strains showed inhibitory activity on solanine in potato tubers, while 15 strains had better inhibition on solanine in potato tubers than CIPC (the inhibition rate was 10.52%). Among them, strain P-NA2-14 (the inhibition rate was 38.37%) showed the highest inhibition on the content of solanine. There were very few previous studies on the solanine-degrading bacteria. A method for screening bacteria capable of degrading solanine was successfully developed by Hennessy et al. (2018), and 14 species of bacteria were isolated from potato soil extracts. The results revealed that most of the efficient solanine-degrading strains belonged to the genus Arthrobacter (Hennessy et al., 2018). The other study showed that Bacillus subtilis could regulate the solanine content in healthy and Fusarium-infected tubers of potatoes during storage (Lastochkina et al., 2020). However, the mechanisms of endophytic bacteria regulated the content of solanine were still unclear, which needed further research. It can be seen that the endophytic bacteria could be used as a safe and efficient new technology or product for the degradation of solanine, and biological control will be a promising way to reduce solanine content.

Strain P-NA2-14 (B. megaterium NBRC 15308T, 99.31%) showed not only a better antimicrobial activity against the two indicator pathogens, but also the best inhibitory activity on solanine, which was proved to be a potential biocontrol bacterium and was selected for further study. Potato tubers with low and high solanine content were obtained by spraying potato tubers with different active components of the fermentation broth of strain P-NA2-14 to study the relationship between the distribution of endophytic bacterial community and the content of solanine in potato tubers.

The results showed obvious differences in the endophytic bacteria community composition among potato tubers with different solanine contents. Pantoea showed the highest proportion in Group CK, Bacillus and Rhodococcus showed the highest proportion in Group H. In addition, Myroides and Polaromonas were only detected in Group L (Table 4). As the promising endophytic bacteria genera for agricultural practices, Pantoea and Bacillus have been extensively studied, which have the ability to dissolve inorganic phosphates, produce siderophores, inhibit the growth of plant pathogens, and produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) among others (Elshaghabee et al., 2017; Soutar and Stavrinides, 2018; Ferreira et al., 2019). The members of Rhodococcus are diverse catalysts that degrade a variety of both natural, organic, and xenobiotic compounds. While, some reports have shown that both Rhodococcus and Polaromonas can promote the transport of sulfur in plants (Borisova, 2011; Gahan and Schmalenberger, 2014; Kim et al., 2018). The application of Myroides in agriculture was rarely reported. Therefore, the isolation and identification of rare endophytic bacteria which were detected in Illumina-based analysis should be carried out by improving the culture conditions and culture techniques, and the interaction between rare endophytic bacteria and host plant metabolites should be studied further.

Meanwhile, Group L had the highest endophytic bacterial community abundance and harbored the largest number of unique OTUs, while Group CK had the least endophytic bacterial community abundance, indicating that the content of solanine influences the endophytic community composition in potato tubers (Figures 6, 8B). This was confirmed by the significant separation of the three groups on the results of PCA (Figure 9A). There was no positive correlation between the content of solanine and community composition of endophytic bacteria in potato tubers, which showed that although the content of solanine was a factor to shape the community composition of endophytic bacteria, the active ingredients of group 40–20 (inhibition rates of solanine was 41.82%) and group 20–30 (inhibition rates of solanine was −22.32%) also had some influence on the community composition of endophytic bacteria. While, the endophytic community of Group H and Group L clustered obviously and the endophytic community of Group CK was significantly different from the other two groups (Figure 9B), which further showed that both the active ingredients played an important role in shaping the community composition of endophytic bacteria. However, whether the active ingredients influenced directly on endophytic bacteria composition and then resulted in the change of solanine content, or stimulated directly on the key enzyme genes in the solanine synthesis pathway and then led to changes of community composition of endophytic bacteria is unknown, which should be the main content for illuminating the mechanism of the active ingredients (group 40–20 and group 20–30) for further study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the relationship between the distribution of endophytic bacterial community and the content of solanine in potato tubers by Illumina-based analysis.

There is a huge potential to use plant beneficial endophytic bacteria as biofertilizers and biopesticides. Although many such bacteria have been isolated and identified, the complex dynamics that control the plant-endophyte association remains poorly understood. So, we need to identify the subtleties that govern the plant-endophyte relationship at the molecular level. The relationship between the distribution of endophytic bacterial community and the content of solanine in potato tubers was preliminarily explored in this study. Further research is needed to explore the interaction between endophytic community composition and the content of solanine by techniques like RNA-seq and Multi-group analysis technique.
